## Day 2: Define Project

People have regular headaches everyday, from every walks of life. It stems from stress, or pressures of everyday living.

There are different types of headaches, which I don't want to list down in this project, and one of them is Migraines.

Migraines are a very debilitating, disabling type of headache. A migraine sufferer will go thru 4 different stages and it may last for days or even weeks or months - in case of chronic migraines. 

A typical stage involves the following:
1. Prodrome - During this stage, people can feel a variety of physical and mental changes such as tiredness, mood changes, increased yawning, increased need to urinate, light and sound sensitivities, thirsty, and a lot more. This can last for few hours to days.

2. Aura - Some people go thru this stage(but not necessarily every time). This occurs due to a spontaneous, slow moving wave that passes over the surface of the brain temporarily affecting the functioning parts it passes over. The symptoms are visual disturbances, temporary loss of sight, or numbness or tingling of the body. This can last for five to 60 minutes.
I am one of those people who does not go thru this stage.
3. Headache - This is the main attack stage. It is typically throbbing, made worse by movement, light or sound.It is also usually on one side or can be on both sides. Nasal congestion is occasionally experienced in this stage.Sickness and vomiting can also happen during this stage. This can last for 4 hours up to 3 days or more.

- The headache gradually fades or some stop suddenly. Sleep, cold showers or dark room can help. Caffeine, and sugary drinks may somewhat help to some people.

4. Postdrome - The final stage of migraine. It can also take days to disappear. The symptoms maybe similar to prodrome. If the symptoms were mood changes, most likely the postdrome will have the same.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to predict likelihood of an incoming migraine. I am unable to predict my own migraines most of the time even if I have a diary or a journal handy. I would assume this is the same predicament of most migraine sufferers - sometimes they feel clear, and sometimes they don't.

I would likely get data from Kaggle, my migraine buddy app, and scrape comments or posts from a migraine community that I have joined on Facebook. If these are not possible, I may conduct a survey and use the data as my reference for this project.

The Machine Learning Model I will be using would be most likely Linear Regression. I may also be free to experiment on other learning models to see which model would be the most accurate or efficient for this research project.

Linear Regression's objective is to establish if there is a relationship between variables. The variables may just be gender, age, food/dietary intake, weather conditions, and hormonal changes. I may have to add more variables as the project progresses.

### Tools to use
- Jupyter
- Python
- Pandas library

### Deployment Process
I may have to use FastAPI for web visualization - so the model can be accessible in public.
