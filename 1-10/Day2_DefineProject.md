## Day 2: Define Project

People have regular headaches everyday, from every walks of life. It stems from stress, or pressures of everyday living.

There are different types of headaches, which I don't want to list down in this project, and one of them is Migraines.

Migraines are a very debilitating, disabling type of headache. It has four different stages before a full blown headache is felt. 

A typical stage involves the following:
1. Prodrome - During this stage, people can feel a variety of physical and mental changes such as tiredness, mood changes, increased yawning, increased need to urinate, light and sound sensitivities, thirsty, and a lot more. This can last for few hours to days.

2. Aura - Some people go thru this stage(but not necessarily every time). This occurs due to a spontaneous, slow moving wave that passes over the surface of the brain temporarily affecting the functioning parts it passes over. The symptoms are visual disturbances, temporary loss of sight, or numbness or tingling of the body. This can last for five to 60 minutes.
I am one of those people who does not go thru this stage.
3. Headache - This is the main attack stage. It is typically throbbing, made worse by movement, light or sound.It is also usually on one side or can be on both sides. Nasal congestion is occasionally experienced in this stage.Sickness and vomiting can also happen during this stage. This can last for 4 hours up to 3 days or more.

- The headache gradually fades or some stop suddenly. Sleep, cold showers or dark room can help. Caffeine, and sugary drinks may somewhat help to some people.

4. Postdrome - The final stage of migraine. It can also take days to disappear. The symptoms maybe similar to prodrome. If the symptoms were mood changes, most likely the postdrome will have the same.

The purpose of this project is to show likelihood of an incoming migraine. I am unable to predict my own migraines most of the time even if I have a diary or a journal handy. I would assume this is the same predicament of most migraine sufferers - sometimes they feel clear, and sometimes they don't.
