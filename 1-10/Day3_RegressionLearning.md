## DAY 2: Linear Regression Learning
The objective of regression is to **establish if there is a relationship between two variables**.

More statistically, establish if there is a **statistically significant** relationship between the two. 
- Ex: Income and spending, wage and gender, student height and exam scores. 


Then forecast new observations. Can we use what we know about the relationship to forecast unobserved values?
 - Ex: What will the sales be over the next quarter?
