## DAY 3: Linear Regression Learning
The objective of regression is to **establish if there is a relationship between two variables**.

More statistically, establish if there is a **statistically significant** relationship between the two. 
- Ex: Income and spending, wage and gender, student height and exam scores. 

Then forecast new observations. Can we use what we know about the relationship to forecast unobserved values?
 - Ex: What will the sales be over the next quarter?

### Variable's Roles

Linear equation is the formula that we are going to use:

```
    y = mx + b
```

In statistics, we can use this formula:
```
$$\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)$$

```

Dependent Variable 
 - we denote this as the y variable.
 - This is the variable whose values we want to explain or forecast.
  - it is dependent on something else

Independent Variable
  - It explains the dependent variable.
  - the values are independent
  - we denote this as the x variable.
