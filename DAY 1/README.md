## DAY 1: Intro to Machine Learning
![ML-screenshot]

Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence(AI) in which algorithms learn by example from historical data to predict outcomes and uncover patterns not easily spotted by humans. 

Some of the examples where Machine Learning is being applied to are stock price predictions, self-driving cars, vision processing,  fraudulent insurance claims, recommendation engines, and more! Seems like we are already dependent on machine learning and we are even not aware of it.

To simplify, machine learning algorithms 'learn' by example, and then users apply those self-learning algorithms to uncover insights, relationships and make predictions about the future trend.

The goal of Machine learning is to act more like humans. The smarter they get, the more they help humans accomplish our goals. If implemented effectively, machine learning will allow businesses of different industry sectors uncover optimal solutions to problems, which leads to real, tangible business value.
