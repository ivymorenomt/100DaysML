## About The Project

This is 100 days of Machine Learning, or ML.

This should serve as my learning space and at the same time, a resource for beginners who wanted to learn Machine Learning with me.

I will have to use this as an introduction to a project that I had been wanting to implement. Within this 100 days of learning, I should be able to complete a viable product.
